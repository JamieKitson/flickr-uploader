		<h1>Backup your Android photos</h1>
		<br>
		<p>
			Do you have a safe copy of your photos and videos in case your phone
			breaks or get stolen?<br>If not, this webpage explains how you
			can make sure you will never loose your valuable life memories.<br>
			<br>There are two popular backup solutions for Android: <a
				href="http://support.google.com/plus/answer/2910392?hl=en">Google+
				Instant Upload</a> and <a
				href="https://blog.dropbox.com/2012/02/your-photos-simplified-part-1/">Dropbox
				Camera Upload</a>. They are fine solutions but have one major drawback:
			your backups are stored in low quality or you have to pay a monthly
			subscription if you want to backup your photos and videos in the
			original high quality format. <br> <br> Recently, Flickr
			changed their photos/videos hosting offer. They now offer an
			astounding terabyte of storage for FREE! This storage is so huge that
			to fill it up with photos you will have to take 100 pictures a day
			for the next 20 years! And Flickr, which is owned by Yahoo, has been
			running since 2004 so you can rest assured your photos are in good
			hands. <br> <br>Flickr does not yet offer a simple backup
			solution for your photos and videos though. Their Android app, for
			instance, does not allow to upload folders of photos and most
			importantly does automatically backup your photos everyday.<br>
			<br>That is why I created Flickr Uploader. It is a simple yet
			powerful app that will let you backup your photos and videos to
			Flickr. You just have to set it up once and every time you take a
			picture, it will make sure a copy is uploaded to Flickr.
