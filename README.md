Flickr Uploader
===============

This goal of this project is to help you automatically backup on Flickr the photos taken with your Android phone.
It works like the Google+ Instant Upload feature.

The main benefit over Google+ Instant Upload is that with a Flick Pro account you can upload an **unlimited** number of photos in **high resolution** for a small amount of money.

[Android-ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator) : it display a nice tab UI above a ViewPager
[ACRA](https://github.com/ACRA/acra) : it sends crash report to a predefined url
[android-donations-lib](https://github.com/dschuermann/android-donations-lib) : it displays a dialog when the user want to donate for the project, it supports Google Play, Paypal and Flattr
[AndroidAnnotation](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations) : it simplifies Android development by the use of annotations to define scope of code (ui thread, background threadâ€¦)
[google-collections](https://code.google.com/p/google-collections/) : a great lib for manipulating lists and multimaps
