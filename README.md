Flickr Uploader
===============

This goal of this project is to create a way to backup automatically photos taken with your Android phone on Flickr.
It works like the Google+ Instant Upload feature.

The main benefit over Google+ Instant Upload is that with a Flick Pro account you can upload an **unlimited** number of photos in **high resolution** for a small amount of money.
